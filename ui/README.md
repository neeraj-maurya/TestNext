UI scaffolds: dynamic form renderer (React) and sample dashboard components.

Files:
- `ui/src/components/DynamicForm.jsx` — runtime form renderer that maps `input_schema` to fields.
- `ui/src/App.jsx` — basic app shell.
- `ui/package.json` — minimal dependencies (React, MUI).

This is a lightweight scaffold for the frontend; integrate into your preferred build system (Vite/CRA/Next.js).
