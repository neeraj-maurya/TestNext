Run the UI demo (simple):

1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
cd ui
npm install
```

2. Integrate into a dev server (e.g., Vite or CRA). This scaffold provides components to copy into your app.

Quick Vite dev + build instructions (Windows PowerShell)

1) From the repository root run:

```powershell
cd c:\Users\neera\VSCodeProjects\TestNext\ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

2) To build a production bundle and preview it locally:

```powershell
cd c:\Users\neera\VSCodeProjects\TestNext\ui
npm run build
npm run preview
```

This will create a `dist/` folder. The `preview` command serves the built files locally on a port printed to the terminal.
